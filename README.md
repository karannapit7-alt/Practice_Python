# Python Learning & Internship Preparation 🐍

Welcome to my practice repository! This space is dedicated to my journey in mastering Python and preparing for my upcoming professional roles.

## College Learning & Practice
In this section, I am practicing everything I learn at *Brainware University*. After attending my college lectures, I come back and implement those concepts here to strengthen my logic and programming skills.

###  Internship Focus
I am currently preparing for two major internships:
1. *CodeAlpha:* Python Programming Internship (Starting 10th Jan 2026).
2. *IncodeVision:* Data Science Internship focusing on Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.

###  Repository Structure
1. /1_Practices_list: Contains Python list operations and logic-based practice questions.
2. More tasks from college and internship modules will be added daily!

*Goal: To build a strong foundation for a career in Data Science and aim for a high-value placement in 2028.
